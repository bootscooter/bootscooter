- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bootscooter
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m employed full-time in marketing for an engineering firm, where I do a lot of graphic design, including email blasts and other small projects requiring 
some web design skills. I'm also working on a photography side hustle and (slowly) designing my own web page. I'm interested in front-end web design, graphic design, HTML, 
CSS, PHP, Wordpress.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently re-learning PHP and Wordpress, as it's been awhile since my introductory courses....
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: polly@portrayals-photography.com
